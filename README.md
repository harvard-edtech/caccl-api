# caccl-smart-canvas-endpoints
A class that defines a set of Canvas endpoints that can be easily accessed. Each endpoint is equipped with the appropriate pre- and post-processing steps to make the Canvas endpoints "behave". For instance, _getStudentRoster()_ fetches student enrollments and removes the test student in post-processing.
